### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is [Bastian Dennstedt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennstedtb/). Even though I am in my mid twenties I am already working for 10 years with SAP technologies, especially programming in ABAP. Besides developing in ABAP, I always try to make small little projects in other languages, like UI5, Typescript, Python or in a few months I want to start with a little bit of SWIFT development.
